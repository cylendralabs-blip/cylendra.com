        "a2": "Absolutely. We use bank-level AES-256 encryption to store your API keys. We only request read and trade permissions—never withdrawal permissions—so your funds remain 100% under your control.",
        "q3": "Do I need KYC verification?",
        "a3": "It depends on the exchange. Binance, OKX, and KuCoin require KYC for most features. Bybit allows basic trading without KYC but with lower limits. We recommend completing KYC for full functionality.",
        "q4": "What happens if my API key is compromised?",
        "a4": "Immediately revoke the API key from your exchange account and generate a new one. Since we never request withdrawal permissions, your funds cannot be stolen even if the key is compromised. Update Orbitra AI with your new API credentials.",
        "q5": "Can I test without real money?",
        "a5": "Yes! Binance, OKX, Bybit, and KuCoin all offer testnet or demo accounts with virtual funds. We highly recommend testing your strategies there before using real capital."
